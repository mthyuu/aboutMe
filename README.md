  - I've been working in programming since ~2021
  - I've just graduated from **_Kennesaw State University_** in **_May 2025_**, and are looking for more programming/dev roles !
  - Most recently have been working in Minecraft/Java Plugin development via PaperMC
      - Check out my Sr. Project repo where my team and I developed a Bloons Tower Defense style gamemode __[here!](https://github.com/KsuBlocksTD/BlocksTD1.0)__ (~9500 lines total)
      - I also more recently joined in on a different, albiet very similar project called __[EventHorizon](https://github.com/StrwbryDev/EventHorizon)__ to volunteer and stay working in development

- ### ðŸ‘€ **My interests**
  - I love all things tech and computersâ€” have been PC gaming since Summer 2018
      - Built my first custom PC in January 2020 and have been upgrading it since !
      - I also just upgraded and compacted it in May 2025, going for a more portable, SFF design
      - Current specs list __[here!](https://pcpartpicker.com/user/MElledge14/saved/#view=jtYyVn)__
  - Currently (mostly) finished a working VPN setup for secure, remote access cloud storage via **__Nextcloud__**, **__Tailscale__**, and **__Docker__** (via Portainer) on my rpi 5
      - I pretty much used this as an excuse to learn more about VPNs, cloud storage, and Docker (and to actually get my money's worth from my dormant rpi)
  - Just got myself a fully-fledged 12U server rack to stow it along with other hardware in for more networking tinkering! Already have a NAS, 24-port network switch, and patch panel in it for now
  - I very much enjoy learning and bettering my skills in all aspects, but most especially in programming, as it develops my creative thought process and allows me to work on and build bigger and better projects !
  - I also simply love typing, and have slowly become more of a keyboard fanatic since [I built mine custom](https://github.com/mthyuu/aboutMe/blob/main/keyboard/keyboard%20desc.md) ~October 2023
      - My fastest typing speed to date, as of 4/14/25: __128 WPM!__
